# Command line interface - `mps2mp4`

This a simple script to convert an imaging file into an `.mp4` video file.
Say you have a file `file.nd2`, then you can simply do
```
mps2mp4 file.nd2
```
or
```
python -m mps mps2mp4 file.nd2
```
and it will create a new `.mp4` with the same name as the imaging file.
